    <h4> <b> A </b> galaxy is a system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, dark matter, bound together by gravity.[1][2] The word is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally 'milky', a reference to the Milky Way galaxy that contains the Solar System. Galaxies, averaging an estimated 100 million stars,[3] range in size from dwarfs with less than a hundred million stars, to the largest galaxies known – supergiants with one hundred trillion stars,[4] each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is in the form of dark matter, with only a few percent of that mass visible in the form of stars and nebulae. Supermassive black holes are a common feature at the centres of galaxies. <br>

      Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical,[5] spiral, or irregular.[6] Many are thought to have supermassive black holes at their centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun.[7] As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant galaxy observed. It has a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and is seen as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang. <br>
      
      In 2016, using 20 years of images from the Hubble space telescope, it was estimated that there were in total two trillion (2×1012)[8] or more[9][10] galaxies in the observable universe, and as many as an estimated 1×1024 stars[11][12] (more stars than all the grains of sand on all beaches of the planet Earth).[13].

        <h2> Main article: Milky Way </h2><br>
        <div style="font-family:sans-serif"> Greek philosopher Democritus (450-370 BCE) proposed that the bright band on the night sky known as the Milky Way might consist of distant stars.[22] Aristotle (384-322 BCE), however, believed the Milky Way was caused by "the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some stars that were large, numerous and close together" and that the "ignition takes place in the upper part of the atmosphere, in the region of the World that is continuous with the heavenly motions."[23] Neoplatonist philosopher Olympiodorus the Younger (c.495-570 CE) was critical of this view, arguing that if the Milky Way was sublunary (situated between Earth and the Moon) it should appear different at different times and places on Earth, and that it should have parallax, which it did not. In his view, the Milky Way was celestial.[24] <br>
             <br>
       <code> According to Mohani Mohamed, Arabian astronomer Alhazen (965-1037) made the first attempt at observing and measuring the Milky Way's parallax,[25] and he thus "determined that because the Milky Way had no parallax, it must be remote from the Earth, not belonging to the atmosphere."[26] Persian astronomer al-Bīrūnī (973-1048) proposed the Milky Way galaxy was "a collection of countless fragments of the nature of nebulous stars."[27] Andalusian astronomer Ibn Bâjjah ("Avempace", d. 1138) proposed that it was composed of many stars that almost touched one another, and appeared to be a continuous image due to the effect of refraction from sublunary material,[23][28] citing his observation of the conjunction of Jupiter and Mars as evidence of this occurring when two objects were near.[23] In the 14th century, Syrian-born Ibn Qayyim proposed the Milky Way galaxy was "a myriad of tiny stars packed together in the sphere of the fixed stars."[29]</code>
       <br>
        <br>
        Actual proof of the Milky Way consisting of many stars came in 1610 when the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study it and discovered it was composed of a huge number of faint stars.[30][31]
        <br>
        In 1750, English astronomer Thomas Wright, in his An Original Theory or New Hypothesis of the Universe, correctly speculated that it might be a rotating body of a huge number of stars held together by gravitational forces, akin to the Solar System but on a much larger scale, and that the resulting disk of stars could be seen as a band on the sky from a perspective inside it.[32][33] In his 1755 treatise, Immanuel Kant elaborated on Wright's idea about the Milky Way's structure.[34]</div>

        <ins><b> In 2021, data from NASA's New Horizons space probe was used to revise the earlier estimate to roughly 200 billion galaxies (2×1011),[14]

         Most galaxies are 1,000 to 100,000 parsecs in diameter (approximately 3,000 to 300,000 light years) and are separated by distances on the order of millions of parsecs (or megaparsecs). For comparison, the Milky Way has a diameter of at least 26,800 parsecs (87,400 ly) and is separated from the Andromeda Galaxy (with diameter of about 152,000 ly), its nearest large neighbor, by 780,000 parsecs (2.5 million ly.)
         
         The space between galaxies is filled with a tenuous gas (the intergalactic medium) with an average density of less than one atom per cubic meter. Most galaxies are gravitationally organized into groups, clusters and superclusters. The Milky Way is part of the Local Group, which it dominates along with Andromeda Galaxy. The group is part of the Virgo Supercluster. At the largest scale, these associations are generally arranged into sheets and filaments surrounded by immense voids.[15] Both the Local Group and the Virgo Supercluster are contained in a much larger cosmic structure named Laniakea.[16]. <br></b></ins></h4>
